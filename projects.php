							UVweb is a school-sized social network allowing students from my university (the <a href="http://www.utc.fr">UTC</a>) to give their opinion on the lectures they've attended.
						</p>
						<p>
							Until december 2012, <a href="http://thomaskeunebroek.fr">Thomas Keunebroek</a> and I were just admins of the website, but we then decided to rebuild it from scratch. We'll like the new UVweb to be smartest, easier to use and to have a responsive design. And of course, as Android lovers, we can't help but develop an Android app for phones and tablets with it.
						</p>
						<p>
							You can follow the project's advancement by checking out the Github pages of the <a href="https://github.com/uvweb/UVweb">web-app</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/uvweb/UVwebForAndroid">Android app</a>.
						</p>
						<p>
							We hope UVweb 2 to be operational by the end of June 2013. Until then, check out the <a href="http://assos.utc.fr/uvweb">current version</a> of the platform !

						<p>
							The system, written in Common Lisp, is based on two inference engines.
						</p>
						<p>
							The first one uses forward-chaining. It starts the deducing process by the goal : a matching student profile for a semester in another university. It then asks questions based on what can be helpful or not for the student to go to the university.
						</p>
						<p>
							The second one, backward-chaing based, starts by the student's profile and asks dynamically the good questions to try and deduce his affinity with the university.
						</p>
						<p>
							Although the code is a bit dense, you can take a look at it <a href="https://github.com/amasciul/RI02-expert">here</a>.
